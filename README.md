# MSc Thesis Code Repository

## 📖 Project Information
- **Thesis Title:** Optimising the Mechanical Response of 3D-Printed Auxetic Lattices  
- **Author:** [Han Nan]  


This repository contains the MATLAB scripts and related resources used in the MSc thesis project.  
The code implements digital image correlation (DIC), stress–strain calculations, and Poisson’s ratio measurements for 3D-printed auxetic lattice structures.
